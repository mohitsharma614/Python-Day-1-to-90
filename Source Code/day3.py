# operators
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y) #Addition
print(x - y) #Subtraction
print(x * y) #Multiplication
print(x / y) #division
print(x // y) #foot division
print(x % y)  #modulus
print(x ** y) #Exponentiation

# 2.Comparision Operators

print(x == y) #Equal to
print(x != y) #not equal to
print(x > y)  #Grater than
print(x < y)  #less than
print(x >= y) #grater than or equal to
print(x <= y) #less than or equal to

# Logical Operators
print(x >5 and y< 10)  #And operator(Returns True if both conditions are true)
print(x > 5 or y > 10) #Or operator(Returns True if atleast one condition is true)
print (not x > 5)  #Not operator(Reverses the condition)

#Assignment Operators
x = 10
x += 5 #i.e x = x+5
x -= 5
print(x)

# #5. Identity and Membership Operators
a = [1,2,3]
b = a
c = [1,2,3]
print(a is b)
print(b)
print(a is c)
print( a == c)
#example
number = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(20 in number)
print(50 not in number)
